"""Provider-agnostic registry for core API native voice catalogs.

Each `core_api_type` that ships built-in TTS voices (e.g. Gemini's Puck/Leda,
future OpenAI/Qwen native voices) registers a `NativeVoiceProvider` here.
Cross-cutting code (config validation, character UI, TTS worker dispatch,
realtime voice routing) consults the registry instead of hard-coding
`if core_api_type == 'gemini'` branches, so adding a second provider is one
adapter file plus one worker registration — not edits in five places.

Two-phase registration avoids circular imports:
  1. The provider metadata module (e.g. `utils/gemini_tts_voices.py`) creates
     and registers a `NativeVoiceProvider` at import time — pure data.
  2. The TTS worker module (`main_logic/tts_client.py`) registers the worker
     callable + api-key resolver after defining the worker, since the worker
     pulls in heavy deps (httpx, soxr, etc.) the metadata module must not.
