"""LLM prompt placeholder leak detector.

Bug class this guards against
-----------------------------
Prompt templates in ``config/prompts/prompts_*.py`` use Python ``str.format()`` style
placeholders like ``{master}`` / ``{window}``. The producer side embeds the
placeholder; the consumer side is responsible for calling ``.format(...)`` to
expand it. When a consumer forgets — e.g. ``sf = _loc(SOME_TEMPLATE, lang)``
returns the raw template string and gets concatenated straight into a system
message — the literal ``{master}`` characters reach the LLM, which is at best
confusing and at worst leaks framework internals into the model output.

Real-world case that motivated this module: PR #1075. ``SCREEN_SECTION_FOOTER``
in ``config/prompts/prompts_proactive.py`` was given a ``{master}`` placeholder so it
mirrored the corresponding header. The header was rendered with ``.format()``;
the footer's consumer in ``main_routers/system_router.py`` used ``_loc()``
without ``.format()``. The literal ``{master}`` shipped to the LLM. Caught only
by a Codex review — i.e. by luck.

Strategy
--------
Per-prompt unit tests don't scale: every new prompt would need someone to
remember to add its test. The only layer that automatically covers all current
*and future* prompts is the LLM-call chokepoint, since every prompt has to
flow through it on the way out. So we hook the request-body construction in
``utils.llm_client.ChatOpenAI._params()`` and the realtime equivalent in
``main_logic.omni_realtime_client.OmniRealtimeClient.update_session()``.

Scope: system role only
-----------------------
We deliberately scan only ``role == "system"`` messages. Justification:

* The bug class is "template not rendered". Templates are almost exclusively
  used in instructional/system prompts. Renderers do not pour templates into
  user/assistant turns in this codebase today.
* User and assistant content can legitimately contain literal ``{...}``
  characters — users paste Python f-string snippets, JSON schemas, Rust
  generic syntax, etc. Scanning those would produce false positives that
  drown the real signal.
* If a future feature ever pushes a template through a non-system role
  (e.g. `system_router` starts injecting a rendered system prompt as a
  ``user`` priming turn), expand the role allowlist below. Don't widen it
  speculatively.

Tool-calling fields (``tool_calls`` arguments JSON, ``tool`` role results)
are also skipped: those are model-generated or pre-serialized JSON where a
bare ``{`` is structural, not a placeholder.

Severity
--------
* Test/CI environments (``PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`` is set, or the user explicitly
  requests with ``NEKO_PROMPT_LEAK_RAISE=1``): raise ``AssertionError``. This
  way *any* existing test that happens to hit the buggy path will fail loud,
  even if it wasn't designed as a prompt-leak test.
* Production: ``logger.warning(...)``. We never want a malformed prompt to
  break the user's running session — but we still want the warning in the
  logs for the bug-bash next morning.

The detector itself must never raise into the LLM call site (other than the
intentional test-mode ``AssertionError``). Callers wrap invocations in
``try/except`` and let ``AssertionError`` propagate while swallowing other
exceptions. See ``utils.llm_client._params`` for the canonical wiring.
