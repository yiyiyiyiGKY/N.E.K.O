"""Unit tests for _build_callback_instruction's (origin × passive) routing.

The host derives ``origin`` from upstream ``event_type``:
- ``event_type == "task_result"`` (agent_server._emit_task_result):
  real task completion → ``origin="task_result"`` → TASK_* templates
  ("任务已完成，请汇报" semantics).
- ``event_type == "proactive_message"`` (proactive_bridge from
  plugin push_message): event stream → ``origin="event"`` → EVENT_*
  templates ("新消息，请回应" semantics; **no** "任务"/"汇报" wording).

Plugin authors cannot influence ``origin``; it is a structural fact of
which SDK method they called (``finish()`` vs ``push_message()``) and
which host path the event flowed through.

These tests pin both the active/passive split and the cross-axis
guarantees:
- TASK ACTIVE renders status_phrase + action_phrase ("已完成 / 汇报").
- EVENT ACTIVE renders neutral wording with no "任务"/"汇报".
- Missing origin silently falls back to "event" (pre-migration compat).
- Explicitly unknown origin values fall back to "event" + warn (signals
  a typo or a producer using an unsupported value, worth surfacing).

Also covers the voice-mode hot-swap renderer
(``_render_pending_extra_replies_by_origin``): the swap path bypasses
``_build_callback_instruction`` entirely and uses CONTEXT_SUMMARY_*
wrappers, so the origin routing must be re-asserted there.
