"""Unit-test-scoped fixtures.

Why this file exists: `main_routers.shared_state._state` is a module-level
dict that `init_shared_state()` mutates in place (no teardown hook). Unit
tests call `init_shared_state(role_state={}, config_manager=cm, ...)`
where `cm` is a `ConfigManager` pointing at a `TemporaryDirectory`. When
that temp dir is torn down, `_state['config_manager']` keeps holding the
dangling reference, and the next test that reads shared state (without
re-initializing) can grab a `config_manager` whose disk paths are gone.

The `_reset_shared_state` fixture below snapshots `_state` before each
unit test and restores it after, so cross-test pollution cannot happen.
Introduced in response to CodeRabbit review on PR #681 — flagged for
tests/unit/test_character_memory_regression.py and
tests/unit/test_cloudsave_autocloud_router.py, but applied globally
because the same leak pattern exists in every cloudsave/character test.
