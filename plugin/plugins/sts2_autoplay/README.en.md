# Quick Start

`sts2_autoplay` connects the local *Slay the Spire 2* state exposed by `STS2 AI Agent` to N.E.K.O. The plugin can read the board, execute legal actions, auto-play according to a strategy, let the cat girl pick a single card, push observations to the frontend, and allow the cat girl to send soft guidance from background tasks to influence the next decision round.

## Usage Tutorial

### Get the MOD

Use Git Clone:
```text
git clone https://github.com/CharTyr/STS2-Agent.git
```

### Install the Game Mod

In Steam, right-click *Slay the Spire 2* and select Manage -> Browse Local Files.

The default Steam game directory is usually similar to:

```text
...\Steam\steamapps\common\Slay the Spire 2
```

Copy the `STS2 AI Agent` mod into the `mods/` folder under the Slay the Spire 2 directory.

If there is no `mods` folder under the Slay the Spire 2 directory, please create one yourself.

```text
Using mods may cause save loss. Please back up your saves or use the console to recover (press "~" in the Slay the Spire main menu and type "unlock all" to unlock all characters and difficulties).
```

After installation, the directory should look like:

```text
Slay the Spire 2/
  mods/
    STS2AIAgent.dll
    STS2AIAgent.pck
    mod_id.json
```

### Launch the Game and Confirm the Interface

Start the game normally first, so that the Mod loads with the game.

After the mod is loaded, in NEKO, enable the cat paw, turn on the plugin, enter the plugin panel, and manually start the Slay the Spire plugin.

### Available Commands

`play card` / `auto-play` / `clear the run` / `how am I playing` / `stop`
`play one card` / `play this card` / `recommend a card` ... and so on...

## Feature Overview

- Connects to the local `STS2 AI Agent` HTTP service and reads game state.
- Supports manually executing one step, background semi-auto play, pause, resume, and stop.
- Supports three decision modes: `full-program`, `half-program`, `full-model`.
- Supports loading strategy documents per character; strategy files are located in `strategies/`.
- Supports cat girl single-card selection: only picks a card from the currently available `play_card` actions, pushes the reasoning first, then executes.
- Supports cat girl soft guidance: the user or cat girl can send natural-language guidance, which will be referenced in the next LLM decision round.
- Supports background observation reports: pushes the current floor, combat, hand, enemy intent, LLM reasoning, etc., to the frontend.
- Supports safety protection: low-HP pause, slow-down on Boss/dangerous attacks, auto-resume after HP recovery, desperate survival strategy, value maximization, and synergy scoring.

## Dependencies

This plugin depends on the local HTTP service provided by the upstream Mod `STS2 AI Agent`:

- In-game Mod: `STS2AIAgent`
- Default local interface address: `http://127.0.0.1:8080`
- Health check address: `http://127.0.0.1:8080/health`

In other words, the plugin works on the following premises:

1. The `STS2 AI Agent` Mod is installed in *Slay the Spire 2*.
2. After the game is launched, `http://127.0.0.1:8080/health` is accessible.
3. The `sts2_autoplay` plugin is enabled in N.E.K.O.

## Plugin Configuration

Configuration file: `plugin.toml`

### Basic Configuration

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `base_url` | `http://127.0.0.1:8080` | Local Spire Agent address. |
| `connect_timeout_seconds` | `5` | Connection timeout in seconds. |
| `request_timeout_seconds` | `15` | Request timeout in seconds. |
| `poll_interval_idle_seconds` | `3` | Poll interval when idle. |
| `poll_interval_active_seconds` | `1` | Poll interval while auto-playing. |
| `action_interval_seconds` | `1.5` | Extra interval between each action. |
| `post_action_delay_seconds` | `0.5` | Wait interval after action execution for the board to stabilize. |
| `autoplay_on_start` | `false` | Whether to start playing automatically after the plugin starts. |
| `semi_auto_autoplay` | `true` | Whether to create a semi-auto task context when starting auto-play. |
| `mode` | `half-program` | Current auto-play mode. |
| `character_strategy` | `defect` | Character strategy name, corresponding to `strategies/<name>.md`. |
| `max_consecutive_errors` | `3` | Maximum consecutive errors; exceeding this is treated as a disconnect. |
| `push_notifications` | `true` | Legacy reserved field. |
| `event_stream_enabled` | `false` | Reserved field, not currently active. |

### Decision Modes

`mode` supports the following values, with corresponding Chinese aliases also accepted:

| Mode | Chinese Alias | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `full-program` | `全程序` | Pure program heuristics, no model calls. |
| `half-program` | `半程序` | Pre-checks programmatically first, then makes one model decision, with legality validation/fallback. |
| `full-model` | `全模型` | Two model calls: first reasoning, then final action; programmatic checks in between, and final legality validation. |

### Character Strategies

`character_strategy` looks up strategy documents under `strategies/<name>.md`. Currently built-in strategies:

- `defect`
- `ironclad`
- `silent_hunter`
- `necrobinder`
- `regent`

You can add Markdown files in `strategies/` to extend strategies. For example:

```text
strategies/my_strategy.md
```

Then set the configuration or entry parameter to:

```text
my_strategy
```

### Frontend Push and Cat Girl Observation

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `llm_frontend_output_enabled` | `true` | Whether to actively push auto-play actions/errors to the frontend. |
| `llm_frontend_output_probability` | `0.15` | Push probability for normal actions; clamped to `0.0 ~ 1.0`. Errors are forced to push. |
| `neko_reporting_enabled` | `true` | Whether to push cat girl observation reports. |
| `neko_report_interval_steps` | `1` | Push an observation report every N auto-play steps; minimum `1`. |
| `neko_commentary_enabled` | `true` | Whether to generate live cat girl commentary in observation reports. When disabled, structured observation reports can still be pushed but `live_commentary.text` remains empty. |
| `neko_commentary_probability` | `0.65` | Trigger probability for normal low-priority commentary; clamped to `0.0 ~ 1.0`. High-priority scenarios such as low HP, lethal, or high-attack can bypass the probability. |
| `neko_commentary_min_interval_seconds` | `4` | Minimum interval in seconds for repeated commentary in the same low-priority scenario, used to reduce spam and repetition. |
| `neko_critical_commentary_always` | `true` | Whether to always voice `critical` / `high` urgency commentary, e.g. low HP, lethal, or high enemy attack. |
| `neko_guidance_max_queue` | `50` | Maximum length of the cat girl soft guidance queue. |

Cat girl observation reports carry trimmed `report`, `neko_context`, `live_commentary`, `task` and other metadata, helping the frontend or dialog logic recognize this as a "process observation" rather than a task completion notification. To save user tokens, the pushed content only retains the current action, HP, hand, enemies, tactical summary, consumed guidance, and task summary.

`live_commentary` provides short voiceover fields for the frontend/TTS: `text`, `scene`, `mood`, `urgency`, `priority`, `tts`, `interrupt`, `tone`, `character_strategy`. Commentary is randomly selected from a template pool by scene to reduce repetition; tendencies are also adjusted by character strategy, e.g. `defect` leans rational, `ironclad` leans steady. It currently covers desperate HP, low HP, lethal, incoming enemy attacks, defending, normal combat, rewards, shop, rest sites, events, the map, as well as event-level commentary like combat end, key relics, and route selection completion.

### Safety Protection and Autonomous Actions

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `neko_auto_low_hp_threshold` | `0.3` | Background auto-play will autonomously pause when current HP ratio drops below this value. |
| `neko_auto_safe_hp_threshold` | `0.5` | Auto-resume is allowed once HP recovers to this ratio. |
| `neko_auto_dangerous_attack_threshold` | `20` | Auto slow-down when incoming enemy damage reaches this value and would break defenses. |
| `neko_auto_resume_after_low_hp` | `true` | Whether auto-resume is allowed after a low-HP pause when HP recovers. |
| `neko_desperate_enabled` | `true` | Whether to enable the desperate survival strategy. |
| `neko_desperate_hp_threshold` | `0.2` | HP ratio that triggers the desperate survival strategy. |
| `neko_maximize_enabled` | `true` | Whether to enable value-maximizing card selection. |
| `neko_synergy_enabled` | `true` | Whether to enable synergy/combo scoring. |

Current autonomous actions include:

- `pause`: Pauses on low HP, waiting for user or cat girl instructions.
- `slow_down`: Temporarily slows the action interval during Boss fights or dangerous attacks.
- `resume`: Resumes after the safe HP condition is met.

## Recommended Phrasing for Regular Users

Regular users do not need to remember the low-level entries below. Prefer passing the user's original phrasing to `sts2_neko_command`, and let the plugin internally decide whether to check status, give advice, actually play a card, execute a step, start auto-play, pause, resume, stop, review recent plays, answer auto-play questions, or use the phrasing as soft guidance during auto-play.

Recommended interaction rules:

| User Phrasing | Plugin Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `is the spire connected` / `what's the situation now` | Only check connection, status, or snapshot; do not operate the game. |
| `how should I play this turn` / `which card is best to play` | Only recommend one playable card and explain the reason; do not auto-play. |
| `play a card for me` / `pick a card and play it` | After explicit authorization, only pick one from `play_card` actions and play it. |
| `play one step for me` / `execute one step` | After explicit authorization, execute one legal action, which may include ending the turn, picking a reward, or moving on the map. |
| `play this run for me` / `auto-play for a bit` | Start semi-auto play; default stop condition is current floor completion. |
| `defend first` / `don't be greedy with damage` | While auto-play is running, this becomes soft guidance for the next decision round; when not running, conservatively ask for clarification rather than acting. |
| `how was that play` / `review the last card I played` | Provide a play-feel review based on the latest lightweight snapshot; do not operate the game. |
| `why play it that way` / `what are you doing` | While auto-play is running, answer the current strategy and board reasoning; do not perform extra actions. |
| `pause for a moment` / `continue` / `let's stop` | Pause, resume, or stop auto-play respectively. |

Safe defaults: consultation does not operate, vague phrasing does not execute dangerous actions; only when the user explicitly says "play for me", "execute", "auto-play", or "take over" will real actions be performed.

## Plugin Entries

The following entries are exposed to the host and can be called directly in N.E.K.O. For regular user scenarios, prefer calling `sts2_neko_command`; other entries are mainly precise control interfaces for developers.

### `sts2_neko_command`

The natural-language master entry for Slay the Spire. Prefer calling it when the user has not explicitly specified a low-level tool.

Parameters:

- `command`: required, the user's original phrasing. Example: `how should I play this turn`, `play a card for me`, `defend first`, `pause for a moment`.
- `scope`: optional, default `auto`. Possible values: `auto`, `status`, `advice`, `one_card`, `one_action`, `autoplay`, `control`, `guidance`, `review`, `question`, `chat`.
- `confirm`: optional, default `false`. Used to confirm high-risk operations such as continuous takeover.

The return includes `intent`, `action`, `executed`, `needs_confirmation`, `summary`, and the underlying `result`.

### `sts2_health_check`

Checks whether the local Spire Agent service is available.

### `sts2_refresh_state`

Forces a refresh of the current Spire state.

### `sts2_get_status`

Gets connection status, auto-play status, current mode, character strategy, semi-auto task, recent errors, recent actions, and other information.

### `sts2_get_snapshot`

Gets the most recently cached game snapshot and currently executable actions.

### `sts2_step_once`

Executes one step under the current strategy.

### `sts2_play_one_card_by_neko`

Lets the cat girl pick and play a card.

Parameters:

- `objective`: optional, user authorization goal. Example: `pick a card and play it for me`.

Behavior:

1. Reads the current player, hand, enemies, and legal actions.
2. Keeps only `play_card` actions.
3. Lets the current mode/strategy pick a card.
4. First pushes "which card I plan to play and why" to the frontend.
5. Re-validates the action is still legal.
6. Plays the card and pushes the completion observation.

If there is no playable card right now, returns `idle` and pushes the failure reason.

### `sts2_start_autoplay`

Starts the background semi-auto play loop.

Parameters:

- `objective`: optional, user authorization goal. Example: `clear this run for me`.
- `stop_condition`: stop condition, default `current_floor`.

`stop_condition` supports:

- `current_floor`: ends after the current floor is completed or the next floor is entered.
- `current_combat` / `combat`: ends after combat is entered during the task and then exited.
- `manual` / `none`: does not auto-complete; must be stopped manually.

After starting, the plugin creates a semi-auto task context and pushes a task-start event to the frontend. When the task completes, `semi_auto_task_completed` is pushed.

### `sts2_pause_autoplay`

Pauses auto-play.

### `sts2_resume_autoplay`

Resumes paused auto-play whose background task still exists. If the background task no longer exists, it safely returns `idle` and will not implicitly restart auto-play.

### `sts2_stop_autoplay`

Stops auto-play and clears the semi-auto task context.

### `sts2_get_history`

Gets recent action and state history.

Parameters:

- `limit`: number of entries to return, default `20`, clamped to `1 ~ 100`.

### `sts2_send_neko_guidance`

Sends cat girl soft guidance to the background auto-play. The guidance enters the queue and is injected into the context for the next LLM decision round.

Parameters:

- `content`: required, natural-language guidance content. Example: `defend first, don't rush damage`.
- `step`: optional, the corresponding step number.
- `type`: optional, default `soft_guidance`.

### `sts2_set_mode`

Sets the auto-play mode.

Parameters:

- `mode`: supports `full-program` / `全程序`, `half-program` / `半程序`, `full-model` / `全模型`.

### `sts2_set_character_strategy`

Sets the character strategy name.

Parameters:

- `character_strategy`: matched against `strategies/<name>.md` after name normalization. For example, `defect` matches `strategies/defect.md`.

### `sts2_set_speed`

Sets speed parameters and writes back to local `plugin.toml`.

Parameters:

- `action_interval_seconds`
- `post_action_delay_seconds`
- `poll_interval_active_seconds`

## Typical Usage

### Check Connection

1. Launch *Slay the Spire 2*.
2. Confirm `http://127.0.0.1:8080/health` is accessible.
3. Call `sts2_health_check` in N.E.K.O.

### Manually Execute One Step

Call:

```text
sts2_step_once
```

The plugin will pick and execute a legal action based on the current `mode` and `character_strategy`.

### Let the Cat Girl Play a Card

The user can say something like to the cat girl:

```text
pick a card and play it for me
```

The host should call:

```text
sts2_play_one_card_by_neko
```

The plugin will only pick from currently playable cards and will not pick end-turn, map, reward, or other actions.

### Let the Cat Girl Help Clear a Floor

The user can say:

```text
clear this run for me
```

The host should call:

```text
sts2_start_autoplay
```

Recommended parameters:

```json
{
  "objective": "clear this run for me",
  "stop_condition": "current_floor"
}
```

While the task is running, observation events are only progress reports and do not represent completion. Only upon receiving the semi-auto task completion event should you tell the user that this floor is done.

### Mid-task Guidance

During auto-play, the user or cat girl can send guidance:

```text
defend first, don't take too much damage
```

Should call:

```text
sts2_send_neko_guidance
```

Recommended parameters:

```json
{
  "content": "defend first, don't take too much damage",
  "type": "soft_guidance"
}
```

The guidance will be referenced in the next LLM decision round. The `full-program` mode does not rely on a model, so soft guidance has limited impact.

## Frontend Push Events

The plugin pushes the following categories of events through the host's message channel. Aside from task start/completion, errors, and single-card previews, normal observations try to use short text and trimmed metadata to reduce user token consumption.

| Event Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `action` | Normal auto-play action observation, controlled by probability. |
| `error` | Auto-play error, force-pushed. |
| `neko_report` | Full cat girl observation report, including current board, hand, enemies, tactical summary, and model reasoning. |
| `neko_card_task_planned` | Cat girl single-card task plans to play a card. |
| `neko_card_task_completed` | Cat girl single-card task executed. |
| `neko_card_task_failed` | Cat girl single-card task could not be executed. |
| `semi_auto_task_started` | Semi-auto task started. |
| `semi_auto_task_completed` | Semi-auto task completed. |
| `neko_autonomous_action` | System autonomously paused, slowed, or resumed. |

Note: `neko_report` is a process observation, not a task-completion notification. The frontend or dialog logic should not describe a single-step action, card play, end-turn, or state refresh as "task complete", "Boss defeated", "combat over", or "run cleared". If the cat girl wants to influence the next decision round, call `sts2_send_neko_guidance`; if she wants to hard-control the flow, call the pause, resume, or stop entries.

## Common Troubleshooting

### Connection Failure When Calling Plugin Entries

Check first:

- Whether the game has been launched.
- Whether the `STS2 AI Agent` Mod has been correctly placed under the game's `mods/`.
- Whether `http://127.0.0.1:8080/health` is accessible.
- Whether the `base_url` in `plugin.toml` is correct.

### `http://127.0.0.1:8080/health` Cannot Be Opened

Check in priority:

1. Whether the game has actually been launched.
2. Whether `STS2AIAgent.dll`, `STS2AIAgent.pck`, and `mod_id.json` have all been copied to the game's `mods/`.
3. Whether file names have been renamed by the system, duplicated, or placed in the wrong directory.
4. Whether you are operating on the Steam game directory rather than the upstream repository directory.
5. Whether a firewall or security software is blocking the local port.

### Auto-play Runs but the Frontend Receives No Messages

Check:

- Whether `llm_frontend_output_enabled` is `true`.
- Whether `llm_frontend_output_probability` is too low.
- Whether `neko_reporting_enabled` is `true`.
- During debugging, you can first set `llm_frontend_output_probability` to `1`.
- Whether the host frontend has received the plugin's pushed messages.

### Cat Girl Mid-task Guidance Has No Obvious Effect

Check:

- Whether the current mode is `half-program` or `full-model`.
- Whether `sts2_send_neko_guidance` returns `ok`.
- Whether the guidance content is specific enough, e.g. "prioritize defense", "attack the lowest-HP enemy first", "save the potion".
- Whether the current legal actions can actually fulfill the guidance.

### Semi-auto Task Never Completes

Check `stop_condition`:

- If it is `manual` / `none`, the task will not auto-complete and you must call `sts2_stop_autoplay`.
- If it is `current_combat`, the task completes after combat has been entered during the task and then exited.
- If it is `current_floor`, it usually completes after the current floor is completed or the next floor is entered.

You can call `sts2_get_status` to inspect `autoplay.task`.

### Event Rooms, Modals, or Transitions Get Stuck

The current version already handles events, modals, and transitions, with priority actions including:

- `confirm_modal`
- `dismiss_modal`
- `choose_event_option`
- `proceed`

If still stuck, first use `sts2_get_snapshot` to inspect the current `screen` and `available_actions`.

### Auto-play Suddenly Pauses or Slows Down

Safety protection may have been triggered:

- Pauses when the HP ratio drops below `neko_auto_low_hp_threshold`.
- Slows down during Boss fights or dangerous attacks.
- If `neko_auto_resume_after_low_hp` is `true`, may auto-resume once HP recovers to `neko_auto_safe_hp_threshold`.

You can call `sts2_get_status` to check the status, or call `sts2_resume_autoplay` / `sts2_stop_autoplay` to handle it.
