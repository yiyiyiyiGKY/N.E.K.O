"""Static check: forbid trailing-slash route paths on FastAPI router/app decorators.

Why this exists
---------------
Project convention: every backend HTTP/WebSocket endpoint is declared WITHOUT
a trailing slash. The convention matches Stripe / GitHub / Google / AWS /
Microsoft REST API Guidelines, but more importantly it sidesteps a class of
production failure under reverse proxies:

* FastAPI/Starlette's ``redirect_slashes=True`` (default) will 307-redirect
  ``/foo/`` to ``/foo``.
* The ``Location`` header is an **absolute** URL built from the request
  ``Host``. Behind a reverse proxy that doesn't preserve ``Host`` (or with
  ``proxy_headers`` off, i.e. ``NEKO_BEHIND_PROXY != 1``), that absolute URL
  points at the internal ``127.0.0.1:<port>`` and the browser dies with
  ``ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED``.
* PR #938 (chara_manager regression on LAN reverse proxies) was exactly this
  bug. See ``.agent/rules/neko-guide.md`` (§"API URL 末尾不带斜杠") and
  ``main_routers/characters_router.py`` docstring for the full write-up.

Avoiding the redirect entirely (= never declaring a trailing slash) makes
the whole class of failure impossible.

What it flags
-------------
Any decorator call of the form:

    @router.get("/foo/")           # trailing-slash literal
    @router.post("/foo/bar/")
    @router.websocket("/ws/foo/")
    @app.put("/api/v1/foo/")

where ``router`` is any name and the HTTP method comes from
``METHOD_NAMES``. Path is the first positional argument or ``path=...``.

Allowed exceptions
------------------
* ``@router.get("/")`` on a router whose declared ``APIRouter(prefix=...)``
  is empty — the literal root page. We have exactly one of these:
  ``main_routers/pages_router.py`` serving ``index.html``. Routers with a
  non-empty prefix are NOT exempt because ``prefix="/api/foo"`` +
  ``@router.get("/")`` registers ``/api/foo/`` which IS a trailing-slash
  route (and triggers the same 307 hazard). Reported by CodeRabbit on
  PR #1082.
* **Explicit alias pair** — when the same function carries BOTH
  ``@router.get("/foo")`` and ``@router.get("/foo/")``, the trailing-slash
  one is a deliberate alias. The 307-redirect attack vector is gone (the
  slash form returns 200 directly), so the convention's safety property is
  preserved. SPA entry points (``/ui`` + ``/ui/``) use this pattern. The
  alias check is **per HTTP method**: a trailing-slash GET needs a sibling
  no-slash GET (a sibling POST does NOT cover it, because GET callers
  hitting the no-slash form would still trigger the 307). For
  ``api_route(..., methods=[...])``, every method in the list must have a
  matching sibling.

Scope
-----
Default scan: ``main_routers/`` + ``app/*_server.py`` +
``plugin/server/routes/``. Pass paths explicitly to scan elsewhere.

Suppression
-----------
None. If you genuinely need a trailing-slash route, delete this script in
the same PR and justify it in the description.

Output
------
Every violation prints as ``path:line:col  API_TRAILING_SLASH  message``.
Exit status is 1 when any violation is found, 0 otherwise.
