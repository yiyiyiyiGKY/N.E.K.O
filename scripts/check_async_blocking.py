"""Static check: forbid blocking stdlib calls inside ``async def`` bodies.

Complements ruff's ASYNC210/220/221/222/251 rules by catching gaps the
flake8-async port does not cover:

* ``threading.Thread.join(timeout=...)`` / ``multiprocessing.Process.join(...)``
* ``queue.Queue.get(...)`` (blocks by default)
* Raw ``socket.recv`` / ``accept`` / ``connect`` on blocking sockets

Heuristic: the analyzer only inspects statements whose **nearest enclosing
function is ``async def``**. A nested sync ``def`` (a common pattern for
thread targets, ``run_in_executor`` callbacks, etc.) masks the outer async
context — its body is NOT inspected. This matches ruff's behaviour and
avoids false positives on dedicated worker code.

Receiver matching uses the *tail name* (rightmost component) of the call
receiver. That lets us tell ``self.q.get()`` (flagged, queue-like) apart
from ``self.ws.send()`` (not flagged, websocket). Names that are too
generic (``send``, ``put``, ``wait``) are not checked here — they hit
httpx / websockets / asyncio.Event far more often than real blocking
stdlib objects, so the noise is not worth the signal.

Depth-1 transitive check
------------------------
A sync helper in this repo, called *directly* from an ``async def``, can
still block the loop even though ruff and the direct-body pass above see
nothing wrong (the helper is a plain ``def``; its body is off-loaded in
our model). A second pass addresses exactly that class:

1. Scan every module-level / class-level ``def`` (not nested inside an
   ``async def``) and mark it as "risky" when its direct body contains a
   recognised blocking stdlib call (``PIL.Image.open``, Fernet
   encrypt/decrypt, ``shutil.*``, ``time.sleep``, ``requests.*``,
   ``subprocess.run``/``call``/``check_*``, ``urllib.request.urlopen``,
   plus the queue/thread/socket tail-name heuristics above).
2. Walk every ``async def`` body again, and for each bare ``foo(...)``
   or ``obj.foo(...)`` call match the tail name against the risky index.
   A hit is reported as: *blocking sync helper '<name>' ... called
   directly from async context; wrap the call in
   ``await asyncio.to_thread(...)``*.

We deliberately stop at depth 1 — tracing deeper chains needs type
inference and/or module-level import resolution, and name-based
heuristics past depth 1 produce more noise than signal. Imports are not
resolved; a helper re-exported or aliased at import time will slip
through. That is a known trade-off — easy to add later, hard to make
quiet today. False positives from name collisions can be silenced per
line with ``# noqa: ASYNC_BLOCK — <reason>``.

Every violation prints as ``path:line:col  CODE  message``. Exit status
is 1 when any violation is found, 0 otherwise.

Suppress a specific line with ``# noqa: ASYNC_BLOCK`` — please follow it
with a one-line justification (reviewed manually).
