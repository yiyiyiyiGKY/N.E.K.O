"""User-activity state machine.

Pure-rules engine: takes signals (system snapshot, window observations,
voice events, conversation timestamps) and emits an ``ActivitySnapshot``
describing the inferred user state and a propensity directive for the
proactive-chat prompt.

No LLM, no external calls. Every decision is keyword/threshold driven so
behaviour is auditable and cheap. The ``open_threads`` field on the
returned snapshot is intentionally a placeholder for v1 — populated by
a future emotion-tier enhancement once the keyword path is fully tuned.

Design choices
--------------

Why dwell-time over EMA for categorical signals: an EMA of "what category
is the active window" would have to be encoded numerically (one-hot per
category, smoothed independently) — clunky, and the natural quantity we
care about ("how long has this category dominated?") is just dwell time.
Numerical signals (CPU, idle) skip EMA too: the system collector already
maintains a 30s rolling avg, which is sufficient for our single
"high CPU helps confirm gaming/work" check.

Why "transitioning" still allows screen-based chat: the user explicitly
clarified — screen channel is the floor, available in nearly every
state. Transitioning only suppresses external sources (web/news/music),
which is the source-weight layer's responsibility, not ours.

Stale-recovery sticky flag: when the state goes ``away → anything``,
we set ``_stale_returning_until = now + STALE_RECOVERY_SECONDS``. Any
classifier read inside that window emits ``stale_returning`` instead of
the underlying state, ensuring the greeting opportunity gets a chance
even if the user's first action was opening their IDE.
