"""Activity snapshot types.

The structured output of ``UserActivityTracker.get_snapshot()`` and the
shared vocabulary used between system-signal collection, the state
machine, and the proactive-chat prompt builder.

Design notes
------------

State and propensity are deliberately separate:
  * ``state`` is the inferred user mode (gaming / focused_work / casual_browsing
    / chatting / voice_engaged / idle / transitioning / stale_returning / away).
  * ``propensity`` collapses the state down to a directive the prompt
    builder can act on (closed / restricted_screen_only / open / greeting_window).

Multiple states map to the same propensity — gaming and focused_work
both produce ``restricted_screen_only`` because the prompt's behaviour
is identical for those, even though the upstream cause differs.

The snapshot is always returned by value; callers must not mutate it.

# Six tones, deliberately vivid (one-line prompt hint each, see
# ``ACTIVITY_TONE_HINTS`` in ``config/prompts/prompts_activity.py``):
#   * ``terse``   — competitive games, rhythm games: short, low-intrusion
#   * ``hushed``  — horror games: deliberately quiet, atmospheric

#   * ``warm``    — voice / chatting / stale_returning: conversational
#   * ``concise`` — focused_work / idle / default: short, professional
#
# ``silent`` is intentionally not a tone — silencing the AI is the
# ``skip_probability`` mechanism's job (probabilistic gate before any
# tone matters), and conflating "voice" with "presence" muddies both.
