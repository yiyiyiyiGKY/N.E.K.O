MemoryRecallReranker — vector pre-rank + LLM rerank for memory recall.

Step 3 of P2.  Replaces the "top-N by evidence_score" heuristic that
``FactStore._aload_signal_targets`` uses today to pick candidates for
the Stage-2 signal-detection LLM call.  The new pipeline is:

  1. **Hard filter** — exclude entries with ``evidence_score < 0``,
     suppressed entries, terminal-status reflections, and persona
     entries marked ``protected`` (character-card sources).  Same
     semantics as today's render-time filters.

  2. **Coarse rank (vectors)** — when the EmbeddingService is
     available AND the caller passed in query texts (typically the
     newly-extracted facts), embed the queries, compute max-cosine
     between each candidate and any query, sort DESC, keep the top
     ``budget * COARSE_OVERSAMPLE`` rows (default 3 ×).  Without an
     embedding service or without query texts, this stage is a no-op
     and the original list passes through.

  3. **Fine rank (LLM)** — when embeddings produced more than
     ``budget`` candidates AND the LLM rerank prompt is configured,
     send the candidate set + query texts to a small LLM call asking
     for the most relevant ``budget`` items.  ``evidence_score`` is
     surfaced in the prompt as an auxiliary signal ("this entry has
     been confirmed N times by the user") rather than mixed into the
     ranking math — the LLM weighs it together with semantic
     relevance.  When the LLM call fails or vectors are off, the
     coarse-rank order (or evidence_score when even coarse failed)
     is used as the final order.

Fallback: when ``EmbeddingService`` is permanently disabled, the
whole pipeline degrades to "evidence_score DESC + top ``budget``" —
exactly the current behaviour, no LLM call cost added.

Why vectors are a *prefilter*, not a replacement: cosine alone can't
tell ``主人喜欢猫`` from ``主人讨厌猫`` (≈0.78), and "semantically
near" entries that the user didn't actually mean to bring up trigger
false positives in Stage-2 signal detection (which would either
reinforce or negate the wrong observation).  Keeping the LLM as the
arbiter means we save *prompt tokens* (smaller candidate set in the
Stage-2 prompt), not *LLM calls* — RFC §3.4 stays unchanged in
shape.
