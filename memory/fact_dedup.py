"""
FactDedupResolver — vector-aware deduplication of newly-written facts.

The flow is intentionally LLM-arbitrated, NOT auto-merge on cosine
threshold:

  1. The embedding-worker sweep computes a vector for each fact and,
     while it has both old and new vectors in hand, scans for
     cosine > FACT_DEDUP_COSINE_THRESHOLD against existing facts of
     the same entity.  Hits go into ``facts_pending_dedup.json``.
  2. The idle-maintenance loop periodically calls ``aresolve(name)``,
     which batches the queue into one LLM call asking the model to
     classify each (candidate, existing) pair as ``merge`` / ``replace``
     / ``keep_both``.
  3. Decisions are applied to facts.json under the FactStore's
     existing per-character file lock, then processed queue items
     are removed.

Why an LLM is in the loop:

  * Cosine alone can't distinguish "主人喜欢猫" from "主人讨厌猫".
    Both surface forms vary by 1 token but ride opposite poles.
  * Hash-based dedup remains the first line of defence (catches exact
    repeats, no LLM cost) and the FTS5 lightweight near-dup check
    handles strong textual overlap.  This module addresses the
    *paraphrase* class — "对猫咪很感兴趣" / "最近养了只猫" — that
    legacy dedup misses entirely.

When the EmbeddingService is disabled, no candidates are ever
enqueued, so ``aresolve`` always sees an empty queue and the legacy
hash + FTS5 dedup path is the entire dedup pipeline — exactly the
behaviour pre-P2.

        Decision vocabulary:
          * ``merge``    — drop the candidate, bump existing.importance
                           by +1 (capped at 10), append candidate_id
                           to existing.merged_from_ids
          * ``replace``  — drop the existing, keep the candidate
                           (paraphrase but the new wording is better)
          * ``keep_both``— no mutation, just clear from queue (LLM
                           judged they're not actually duplicates)

        Decisions referencing ids that no longer exist (e.g. a
        concurrent /process absorbed them) are silently skipped —
        the next sweep will re-enqueue if the situation recurs.

        Conflict avoidance (Codex PR-957 P1): if the LLM returns
        reciprocal decisions in the same batch — e.g. ``merge`` for
        (c1, e1) (drop c1) and ``replace`` for (e1, c1) (drop e1) —
        a naive "remove all ids in ids_to_remove at the end" would
        delete BOTH facts and leave the user with nothing.  The
        defensive guard is an in-loop check: if either side of the
        current pair is already scheduled for removal by a prior
        decision, skip this decision entirely.  The earlier decision
        wins (LLM ordering matters); the conflicting pair is still
        consumed (so the next round doesn't keep flagging it).

        Returns ``(applied_count, processed_pair_keys)``.  The set
        contains the (candidate_id, existing_id) keys for queue
        entries the caller should *remove* — exactly the entries we
        applied or consumed via the conflict guard, NOT the ones we
        skipped due to malformed LLM output (those stay queued for
        retry).
